  <h1>Title: <q>Love Beyong of the Wrong Time</q></h1>
  <h2><q>Part 9</q></h2>
<hr>
  <p>
    As he stepped through the portal back to his own dimension, Ryuo felt an indescribable sense of loss, but he carried with him the memories of their loveâ€”a love that had defied time and dimensions, a love that had the power to change worlds.
      <br>
    Back in his own world, Ryuo never forgot Nicole, and he often looked up at the night sky, knowing that somewhere out there, in a dimension beyond his reach, their love continued to shine, a testament to the enduring power of love that could transcend even the most impossible of circumstances.
